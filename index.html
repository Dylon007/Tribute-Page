        <h2>Imprisonment:</h2>
        <li>In 1962, Mandela was arrested and, after the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for plotting to overthrow the government.</li><br></br>
        <li>Mandela spent 27 years in prison, most of them on Robben Island, enduring harsh conditions but remaining a symbol of resistance against oppression.</li><br></br>
        <li>He famously said, "I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society.</li><br></br>
        <p>Released from prison on February 11, 1990, after international pressure and negotiations with the South African government led by F.W. de Klerk.

          In 1993, Mandela and de Klerk were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to peacefully end apartheid.
          Mandela was elected as South Africaâ€™s first black president in 1994, leading a government focused on healing the nation's wounds and promoting racial harmony.</p>
